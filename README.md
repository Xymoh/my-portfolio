# My personal portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Link to my website

### How did I styled it?

I used React framework with the styled-components library. My preference was to split up the website onto several components so it would be easier in the future for small updates.

### Where do I host it?

Website is hosted on Netify! Check out them by yourself. [Link here](https://www.netlify.com/)

### Will it have any future updates?

It is gonna have some more slight updates. Unfortunately, right now I'm being busy with other team projects as also with the university.
